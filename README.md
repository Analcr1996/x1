# x1:  Lights, Action, Camera!
Create a scene plus some action for your creature.

Design your own "creature" (and give it a better name than "Zoog").
Also design a "scene" with sky, sun, grass, and a few other features such as a tree and a house.

Modify the "starter" code in the "x1.java" file to redraw your scene in each frame,
make your creature move as described below, and show it at the new coordinates (x,y).

CREATURE:  
* Use at least three different shapes and colors for your creature.
* Also display its name in a contrasting color.

ACTION:  The creature should move as follows:
* Use the variables x and y for the location of your creature.
* Start in the middle of the window.
* Move in each frame by adding "dx" and "dy" to the coordinates at a rate of "dx" and "dy"

MOUSE CLICK:
* When the mouse is clicked, change x and y to the coordiantes of the mouse, and set dx and dy to random values.
